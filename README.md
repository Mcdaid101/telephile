![Website Mock Up]()
&nbsp;

# Purpose
I built this website as my fourth project for the code institutes full stack development and e-commerce applications course. 
I built this website from scratch using the knowledge I gained from the course where I studied the basics of Python, HTML, Javascript and CSS.

# Target audience
* Tv Lovers 
* Bloggers

## How to play
* This game is constructed like a traditional text adventure game where the player is asked to input what direction they would like to head. 

* For example head north for kitchen, head south for bedroom and head east for bathroom.

* Once the desired input is entered the player will arrive there and be allowed to return to previous locations with items picked up from other ones.

* Items acquired through visiting new locations and solving puzzles are vital to the player's progress and will allow he/she to escape and complete the game. 

* If a player is caught or killed by the guards they will fail the game and be offered another attempt. 

## Features 

1.  The game features 10 different rooms / areas to explore some are possible to return to while others such as the area you began in, are not.

</p>
</details>
<br>

2.  The player is given multiple choices to explore a different direction in each room / area they venture into. 

3. The game accepts user input to add their name, which is referenced throughout and to move direction and tells the player to enter which word to go which direction.

<p>

<br>

4. User input can also determine whether the player wants to undertake a certain task or pick up an object. 

<details><summary>Choice of task</summary>

<br>

5. Validation is implemented on every choice the player can make, if a player enters something other than the game requested, they will be met with text that is coloured red to tell them the only options they can enter to proceed.

<p>

</p>
</details>
<br>

6. If the player is caught or killed by the guards he will lose, the game will then offer them another chance to play again or to exit the game entirely. 

<details><summary>Game over</summary>

</p>

<br>

7. The delay print function makes the text print out slowly as if it is just appearing on screen one letter at a time mimicking text adventure games which were popular in the 1980's.

8. The text's green color is also chosen to make the game seem like a terminal adventure game from the past, it gives the game a retro and authentic feel.

9. To differentiate between each room unique ASCII art is loaded on entering giving the game a better design. 

10. A progress bar which simulates a new area rendering is added to the bottom of each area when the player inputs which direction he would like to go.

## Future Features 

* An OOP combat system when facing the guards 
* Allow players to interact with their fellow prisoner Red Hugh and find out more about him. 
<br>

# Design 

![Flow Chart](assets/images/flow_chart%20.png)

<br>

* I designed this game to make it look like an old 80's style terminal game.
* To do this I created the delay_print() function which printed out the game's script in a typewriter esque way.
* Using the colorama library I gave the text a green colour with Fore.GREEN, to further it's traditional terminal game feel.
* I used Fore.RED to give any validation fails and the game ending screens the colour red. 
* Textualize Rich created the progress bar to simulate the new areas rendering.
* The ASCII art comes from an online Generator and from an ASCII art archive which was very useful and saved me typing out any ASCII images. 
* Regex helped me with input validation to ensure that the players inputs matched the games input directions

# Testing and validation

I have manually tested this project by doing the following:

* Passed the project through a pep8 linter and confirmed there is no problems.
* Tested in my gitpod terminal and the Heroku terminal.
* Tested each user story to make sure each one passes. 

Pep8
* No errors were returned from Pep8online.com or from extendsclass.com/pythontester. 


# Deployment 

## Creating this project
This project was created by navigating to the Code Institute's Gitpod student template and clicking the 'use this template' button. I then inputted the repository name "telephile" and included all branches. With the repository now created, I used the browser version of Vs Code to create the project. 
<br>

I used the following commands throughout this project:
* Git add . - This added my file to the staging area to be committed
* Git commit -m - This command committed any changes to the local repository along with a message
* Git push - pushed my changes to the github repository and to Heroku 
* git reset --hard HEAD^ - This removed my last commit 
* python3 manage.py runserver - This ran my code in the terminal
* python3 manage.py makemigrations - This made my migrations
* python3 manage.py migrate - This migrated my changes to my databases

## Heroku
 This website is deployed on the Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku

### Steps for deployment 
* Fork or clone this repository
* Created a new heroku app through build app
* Set the buildpacks to Python and NodeJs in that specific order
* Linked the heroku app to the repository via github
* Clicked automatic deploys so each git push would automatically go to the heroku app
* This was ideal for testing so I could see what the game looked like on the Heroku terminal with each git push
