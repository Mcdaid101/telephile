2.  The player is given multiple choices to explore a different direction in each room / area they venture into. 

3. The game accepts user input to add their name, which is referenced throughout and to move direction and tells the player to enter which word to go which direction.

5. Validation is implemented on every choice the player can make, if a player enters something other than the game requested, they will be met with text that is coloured red to tell them the only options they can enter to proceed.

6. If the player is caught or killed by the guards he will lose, the game will then offer them another chance to play again or to exit the game entirely.

7. The delay print function makes the text print out slowly as if it is just appearing on screen one letter at a time mimicking text adventure games which were popular in the 1980's.

8. The text's green color is also chosen to make the game seem like a terminal adventure game from the past, it gives the game a retro and authentic feel.

9. To differentiate between each room unique ASCII art is loaded on entering giving the game a better design. 

10. A progress bar which simulates a new area rendering is added to the bottom of each area when the player inputs which direction he would like to go.

# Testing and validation

I have manually tested this project by doing the following:

* Passed the project through a pep8 linter and confirmed there is no problems.
* Tested in my gitpod terminal and the Heroku terminal.
* Tested each user story to make sure each one passes. 

Pep8
* No errors were returned from Pep8online.com or from extendsclass.com/pythontester. 


# Deployment 

## Creating this project
This project was created by navigating to the Code Institute's Gitpod student template and clicking the 'use this template' button. I then inputted the repository name "telephile" and included all branches. With the repository now created, I used the browser version of Vs Code to create the project. 
<br>

I used the following commands throughout this project:
* Git add . - This added my file to the staging area to be committed
* Git commit -m - This command committed any changes to the local repository along with a message
* Git push - pushed my changes to the github repository and to Heroku 
* git reset --hard HEAD^ - This removed my last commit 
* python3 manage.py runserver - This ran my code in the terminal
* python3 manage.py makemigrations - This made my migrations
* python3 manage.py migrate - This migrated my changes to my databases

## Heroku
 This website is deployed on the Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku

### Steps for deployment 
* Fork or clone this repository
* Created a new heroku app through build app
* Set the buildpacks to Python and NodeJs in that specific order
* Linked the heroku app to the repository via github
* Clicked automatic deploys so each git push would automatically go to the heroku app
* This was ideal for testing so I could see what the game looked like on the Heroku terminal with each git push
