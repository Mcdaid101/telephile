# Testing and validation

I have manually tested this project by doing the following:

* Passed the project through a pep8 linter and confirmed there is no problems.
* Tested in my gitpod terminal and the Heroku terminal.
* Tested each user story to make sure each one passes. 

Pep8
* No errors were returned from Pep8online.com or from extendsclass.com/pythontester. 


# Deployment 

## Creating this project
This project was created by navigating to the Code Institute's Gitpod student template and clicking the 'use this template' button. I then inputted the repository name "telephile" and included all branches. With the repository now created, I used the browser version of Vs Code to create the project. 
<br>

I used the following commands throughout this project:
* Git add . - This added my file to the staging area to be committed
* Git commit -m - This command committed any changes to the local repository along with a message
* Git push - pushed my changes to the github repository and to Heroku 
* git reset --hard HEAD^ - This removed my last commit 
* python3 manage.py runserver - This ran my code in the terminal
* python3 manage.py makemigrations - This made my migrations
* python3 manage.py migrate - This migrated my changes to my databases

## Heroku
 This website is deployed on the Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku

### Steps for deployment 
* Fork or clone this repository
* Created a new heroku app through build app
* Set the buildpacks to Python and NodeJs in that specific order
* Linked the heroku app to the repository via github
* Clicked automatic deploys so each git push would automatically go to the heroku app
* This was ideal for testing so I could see what the game looked like on the Heroku terminal with each git push
